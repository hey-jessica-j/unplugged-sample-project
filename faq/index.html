                <h4>How do i get to the Unplugged retreat?</h4>
                <p>It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <h4>What kind of team is right for the unplugged retreat?</h4>
                <p>He heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result. It had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat. As soon as he recovered from the surprise, he saw the crack in the windshield. It seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <h4>What size teams can you accommodate?</h4>
                <p>What have you noticed today? I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with your finger, you make an "I" which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before. What have you noticed today?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <h4>Is there really no wifi available?</h4>
                <p>He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. His heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint. "It wasn't a gunshot, it wasn't a gunshot," he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint.</p>
